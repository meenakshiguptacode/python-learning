## Overview
This repository is structured to help learners dive into Python programming and gradually move from beginner to intermediate concepts. The exercises are created with simplicity in mind but cover a wide range of topics necessary to get proficient in Python development.

Each file is designed to focus on a specific programming concept, providing example code that you can run, modify, and learn from. Additionally, most files include comments explaining how the code works.

## Topics Covered:
### 1. **Basic Python Syntax**:
   - Variables, Data Types (int, float, string, list, dict, tuple), Operators
   - Understanding expressions, indentation, and input/output

### 2. **Control Flow**:
   - Conditionals: `if`, `else`, `elif` statements
   - Loops: `for` loops, `while` loops, loop control statements like `break` and `continue`
   
### 3. **Functions and Recursion**:
   - Function definitions, arguments, return values
   - Recursive functions, factorial, Fibonacci sequence
   
### 4. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - Classes and Objects
   - Methods, Constructors (`__init__`)
   - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation

### 5. **Error Handling**:
   - Exception handling using `try`, `except`, `finally`
   - Custom exceptions and error messages
   
### 6. **File Handling**:
   - Reading and writing files (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`)
   - File modes and handling large files

### 7. **Modules and Libraries**:
   - Importing Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries like `os`, `sys`, `math`
   - Using `pip` to install external libraries and examples
   
### 8. **Miscellaneous Concepts**:
   - List comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions
   - Sorting, lambda functions, map, filter, and reduce
